Jenkins-Sonarqube Integration:

1. Not able to login as "jenkins" user with change user command 
$ sudo su - jenkins > Last login: Sat Jun 26 07:56:08 UTC 2021 on pts/0
$ grep jenkins /etc/passwd > jenkins:x:495:441:Jenkins Continuous Integration Server:/var/lib/jenkins:/bin/false
$ whoami > ec2-user
while user already created: $ sudo useradd jenkins >> useradd: user 'jenkins' already exists and we can login with any new user created succesfully.
Workaround:
$ sudo su - jenkins -s /bin/bash or sudo su -s /bin/bash jenkins
-bash-4.1$ whoami > jenkins
-bash-4.1$ echo $HOME > /var/lib/jenkins
-bash-4.1$ cd .ssh
-bash-4.1$ pwd > /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh


2. Fogot "jenkins" user password
Disable Jenkins Security by editing config.xml file to change the security setting from "true" to "false" <useSecurity>true</useSecurity> and save the chnages.
$ sudo nano /var/lib/jenkins/config.xml
$ sudo systemctl restart jenkins  ( Restart Jenkins service )
Password Change: Once Jenkins Dashboard is refreshed delete the "admin" account and then recreate it.
Delete account: People / click on User ID "admin" / delete the admin credentials.
Create: Go to Jenkins / Manage Jenkins / Configure Global Security / Enable Security check box (if visible) / select Jenkinsâ€™ own user database under Security Realm /
select Logged-in users can do anything under Authorization section / Unselect Allow anonymous read access / Save the settings
Save settings will redirect to a page to Create First Admin User credentials.
